**A Poem For You ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡**
- See It Through <br>
When youâ€™re up against a trouble, <br>
    Meet it squarely, face to face; <br>
Lift your chin and set your shoulders, <br>
    Plant your feet and take a brace. <br>
When itâ€™s vain to try to dodge it, <br>
    Do the best that you can do; <br>
You may fail, but you may conquer, <br>
    See it through! <br>
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Edgar A. Guest.
